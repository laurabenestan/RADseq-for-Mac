# RADseq-softwares
The goal of this project is to Downloading programs and packages usefull for RADseq studies
to setup their computers for RADseq genomic analysis.

## Install [VCFTOOLS](http://vcftools.sourceforge.net/)
VCFtools is a program package designed for working with VCF files, such as those generated by [STACKS](http://catchenlab.life.illinois.edu/stacks/).

## Install [PLINK](http://zzz.bwh.harvard.edu/plink/download.shtml)
PLINK is a free, open-source whole genome association analysis toolset, designed to perform with tfam and tped files that are easily converted from vcftools via the ***plink-tped*** following command:
```{r, engine = 'bash', eval = FALSE}
vcftools --vcf nameofyourfile.vcf --plink-tped --out nameofyourfile
done
```

## Install [ADMIXTURE](http://software.genetics.ucla.edu/admixture/)
ADMIXTURE is a software tool for maximum likelihood estimation of individual ancestries from multilocus SNP genotype datasets. It uses the same statistical model as STRUCTURE but calculates estimates much more rapidly using a fast numerical optimization algorithm.
To use ADMIXTURE, you need to transfor your file vcf file into a bed format via plink by typing the ***make-bed*** command available in PLINK:
```{r, engine = 'bash', eval = FALSE}
plink --tfam nameofyourfile.tfam --tped nameofyourfile.tped --make-bed --out nameofyourfile
done
```

## Install [R studio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)
R studio has developped an integrated development environment for R, with a console that supports direct code execution.

# Install devtools package
First install devtools package that allows you to directly download R package available in github.
```{r}
install.packages("devtools")
```

Then, a variety of useful package for population genomics such as ***adegenet***, ***strataG***, ***assigner*** are available in R.

```{r}
install.packages("adegenet")
install.packages("strataG")
install.packages("assigner")
install.packages("radiator")
install.packages("ape")
install.packages("poppr")
install.packages("hierfstat")
install.packages("dartR")
install.packages("StAMPP")
install.packages("genetics")
install.packages("LDna")
install.packages("ade4")
```
