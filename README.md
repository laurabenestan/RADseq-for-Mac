### RADseq-softwares
The goal of this project is to Downloading programs and packages usefull for RADseq studies
to setup their computers for RADseq genomic analysis.

### Install [VCFTOOLS](http://vcftools.sourceforge.net/)
VCFtools is a program package designed for working with VCF files, such as those generated by [STACKS](http://catchenlab.life.illinois.edu/stacks/).

### Install [PLINK](http://zzz.bwh.harvard.edu/plink/download.shtml)
PLINK is a free, open-source whole genome association analysis toolset, designed to perform with tfam and tped files that are easily converted from vcftools via the ***plink-tped*** following command:
```{r, engine = 'bash', eval = FALSE}
vcftools --vcf batch_filtered.vcf --plink-tped --out batch_filtered
```
